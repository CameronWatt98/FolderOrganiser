# FolderOrganiser
A simple windows form application that uses c# to organise a directory until sub directories by date
Functionality:
1.You can take a directory and put the files into folders based on date
  a) If you select "Month" it will organise into monthly sub directories
  b) If you do not select an option you will be given an error message
  c) If you are organising a large set of file especially with larges gaps of time between
    files. It is best practise to selecct the "Remove Empty Folders" radio button.
    This button removes any unused folders from the directories that are created. 
2. If you add new files to the the root directory and run the project again it will put the file into
   the correct sub directory and not ovveride what was already there.
3. This app is meant for personally use and so has not been tested thoroughly. If you encounter bugs let me know 
   and I will try and sort them.
